# localDataHomework

Homework showing how to display data in your local storage but is also supposed to pull back and print on to the page.

# Breaking in Web4

Locally my code gives me my data, no errors at all in the console but for some reason web4 is saying Students can't be returned as null... " Cannot read properties of null (reading 'Students')" is the error but everything works decently locally. I did hiccup on printing it to the document.
